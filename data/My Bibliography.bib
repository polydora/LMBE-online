abstract = {Thirty 'rock-populations' of the intertidal isopod, Jaera albifrons (Isopoda: Asellota), from South Wales area were found to display a significant and persistent sex ratio bias, with females outnumbering males by up to 12 to 1. This thelygeny was not mirrored in broods that were isolated in aquaria after insemination, nor in broods that developed under various temperature and light regimes. Such a discrepancy suggests that the mechanism generating sex ratio biases in natural populations is not innate, nor is influenced by cytoplasmic or environmental factors. The possible causes of thelygeny in natural populations are discussed.},

@article{Ragnarsson1999,
abstract = {Two field experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of mussels (Mytilus edulis) on fauna and on sediment characteristics. In the first experiment mussels were removed from within an established mussel bed to create bare patches and in the second experiment mussels were transplanted to an adjacent bare sandflat. In the mussel removal experiment, mobile epibenthic crustaceans (predominately Gammarus spp. and Jaera albifrons) were markedly reduced in bare patches whereas infaunal species were much less affected. In the mussel transplant experiment, mobile epibenthic crustaceans (e.g. Gammarus spp. and Jaera albifrons) colonised mussel transplant plots, but were absent at all times from the adjacent sandflat sediments. The polychaetes Eteone longa and Pygospio elegans were both significantly reduced in mussel transplant plots, whilst Capitella spp. increased in numbers. Mussels clearly had marked effects on both the fauna and sediments probably through a combination of biodeposition and filtration by the mussels and the provision of a structurally complex habitat.

@article{Khaitov2007,
abstract = {Abstract It is well known that females of “Jaera albifrons” species complex cannot be determined on the basis of morphological analysis. In this work, an attempt to separate females\nof three Jaera species on the basis of morphometric characters, the length of so-called “coupling zones” (CZ), was made. Coupling zones\nare those parts of the partners' bodies that contact during copulation. Female CZ is a region between the posterior edge of\nthe pleotelson and the border between the fourth and the fifth thoracic segments, where openings of dorsal vaginas are situated.\nMale CZ extends from the anterior edge of the cephalon to the first abdominal segment carrying the copulative organ. Absolute\nand relative lengths of CZ were used. The latter was calculated as ratio of absolute length of CZ to body length. Two settlements\nof Jaera in the White Sea were studied for 3 years. Species composition of these populations was quite different (the first one was\ndominated by J. ischiosetosa and the second by J. albifrons and, 1 year by J. praehirsuta). Males of different species were shown to be distinct in terms of absolute and relative length of CZ. Frequency distributions\nof absolute and relative CZ length of females differed significantly in the two settlements. The experiments based on male\nchoice in mixed samples were organized. They revealed that females chosen by males of different species differ significantly\nby CZ parameters.\n},
